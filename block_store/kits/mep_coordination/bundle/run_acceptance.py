"""End-to-end acceptance run on the real fixture. Produces ACCEPTANCE.md.

This is the evidence, not a demo. It answers the questions the order asks and
records the numbers, including the ones that are unflattering.

Central check: the top-50 must contain ZERO bounding-box-only false positives.
That is measurable rather than rhetorical -- for every pair the AABB filter
admits, the mesh engine gives a verdict, and a pair the boxes called a clash
while the meshes call it clear IS the false positive the old detector emitted.
We count them and prove none survive into the queue.
