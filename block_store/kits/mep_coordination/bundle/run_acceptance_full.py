"""Full acceptance: find -> rule -> triage -> resolve -> clone -> re-run -> diff.

This closes the loop the order asks for. It is not a demo: it applies the
change set to a COPY of the fixture, re-runs detection on that copy, and asks
version_diff whether the clashes the kit said it would fix actually went away.
The kit grades itself and the grade is written down whatever it says.

Every number in ACCEPTANCE.md comes from this run.
