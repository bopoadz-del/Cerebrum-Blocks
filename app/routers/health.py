"""Liveness, readiness, and authenticated diagnostics.

Three distinct concerns, deliberately kept apart:

* **Liveness** (`/health`, `/v1/health`) — unauthenticated, zero I/O,
  always 200. Answers only "is the process accepting requests". Render's
  deploy gate and the Docker HEALTHCHECK poll this continuously, so it
  must stay trivial; `app/dependencies.py::init_blocks` documents what
  happens when it is not (workers killed mid-pre-warm).
* **Readiness** (`/ready`, `/v1/ready`) — unauthenticated (a platform
  probe cannot present a bearer token) but non-revealing: check names and
  a pass/fail only. Returns 503 when a load-bearing dependency is broken
  so the platform can actually fail a health check. The previous
  `/health` returned "healthy" unconditionally, so a service with an
  unwritable data disk looked identical to a working one.
* **Diagnostics** (`/v1/system/diagnostics`, `/stats`,
  `/v1/system/health`) — authenticated. The audit found the old
  unauthenticated `/health` shelled out to the Kimi CLI on every probe
  and returned its stdout, its stderr, and the raw value of the
  KIMI_CLI_PATH env var to any caller, while also returning the full
  block inventory that `app/routers/blocks.py` is deliberately auth-gated
  to protect. Both now require a key, and the subprocess is TTL-cached
  off the probe path entirely.
