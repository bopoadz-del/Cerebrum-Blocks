"""Grounding for generated calculations: which definition answered, or none.

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
-----------------------
``formula_executor_v2`` asks an LLM to write Python for a task and runs it in
the sandbox. The output is a number and some code. Nothing in that output
distinguishes two very different things:

* ``gross_margin_ratio`` computed from the definition the platform ships --
  ``(revenue - cogs) / revenue``, an identity, checkable, sourced;
* ``gross_margin_ratio`` computed from whatever the model decided it meant
  that morning.

Both render as a number with plausible code beside it. The second is the one
that quietly reports a different figure than the client's accountant, and
today there is no way to tell them apart after the fact.

THE THREE STATES
----------------
Every result is classified, and the classification is a fact about the
inputs rather than a judgement about the answer:

``grounded``
    The task names a quantity the definition set defines. The definition is
    injected into the prompt and reported back with its tier and provenance.

``user_specified``
    The task supplies its own arithmetic (``(a - b) / a``, ``price * 1.05``).
    The caller said what to compute, so there is nothing to ground it
    against and nothing is wrong. Deliberately left free -- per the ruling,
    user-specified arithmetic is not second-guessed.

``model_generated``
    The task names a quantity, no definition matches it, and the model
    derived one anyway. Not an error -- it is frequently the right answer --
    but it is the model's derivation rather than the platform's, and the
    output says so.

Only the third is a flag, and it is visible in the result, not buried in an
audit log. A caller can render it; a reviewer can grep for it.

WHERE THE DEFINITIONS COME FROM
-------------------------------
The base set is kernel-tier (CerebrumDev.ai #200/#202): it ships into every
generated product via the kernel copytree, at
``app/cerebrum_product_kernel/formulas/universal_definitions.json``. A domain
kit may overlay it -- extend with new ids, or override a base definition by
naming the address it replaces. The precedence rule lives with the kernel;
this module only consumes the resolved set.

In the Store repo itself the kernel is not vendored, so the base set is
absent and every task classifies as ``user_specified`` or
``model_generated``. That is the honest degradation: no definitions means
nothing is grounded, and the output says nothing is grounded rather than
implying it was checked.
