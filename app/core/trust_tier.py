"""Block-manifest ``trust_tier``: a provenance claim, not publisher reputation.

Pin: mirrors CerebrumDev.ai ``backend/app/factory/compliance_gate.py``
``ACCEPTED_TRUST_TIERS`` at factory commit ``eacc254``.

Factory is not a submodule or workspace dependency of this repo. Do not
import it. ``load_blocks_registry`` lives only in CerebrumDev.ai
``backend/app/factory/dual_registry.py`` and currently leaves
``BlockRef.trust_tier`` empty for refs loaded from this registry (it reads
the Factory shelf only). Teaching that loader to read this field is a
Factory change.

This field is NOT ``publisher_tier`` (``certified`` / ``reviewed`` /
``community`` / ``revoked``). ``publisher_tier`` is a platform assertion
about the *publisher*. ``trust_tier`` is a provenance claim about the
*block*:

- ``platform`` — the block ships inside this repository
- ``contributor_reviewed`` — a named reviewer signed it off
