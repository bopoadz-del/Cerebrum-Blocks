"""Trust-scope enforcement for the live block-execution path.

The action-contract kernel (``app.blocks.core.action_contract``) defines the
reserved trust-scope keys and strips them from model-supplied arguments — but
until now it only ran inside generated products. This module wires the same
contract into ``/v1/execute``: caller-supplied identity/permission scope never
reaches a block, and the server-derived scope (from the validated API key)
always does.

At this surface three of the kernel's reserved keys are content-level, not
scope: ``domain`` (a search/filter facet, e.g. construction_advisor),
``context`` (conversational content, e.g. chat) and ``project_id`` (a
workspace selector pending the trial-boundary work). They stay caller-visible;
everything identity- or permission-bearing is server-controlled.
