"""The eight invariant kinds, plus `band`. One implementation each, shared by
every kit. Nothing here knows what a runway or a slab is.

  grounding        does this figure exist in evidence?                    H3
  qualifier        is it accompanied by what makes it actionable?          H3
  unit_discipline  are unit and datum stated, and not mixed?          H2 + H3
  authority        does it come from the class of source that governs?     H1
  provenance       was it carried from another entity or revision?        H3
  currency         has the thing that invalidates it happened?            H3
  scope            is the question answerable from documents at all?      H0
  derivation       do the stated working and the stated result agree?     H3
  band             is the value possible / is it two-sided?               H2

Each kind exists because a defect of that shape shipped to a live product and
was caught by counting, not by review.

HOOKS. The spec's routing map (§2) fixes a hook per kind. A record may state its
`hook:` explicitly, and the loader accepts it only when it is that kind's spec
hook -- or H4, which by definition re-runs the H3 checks on the deliverable.
Anything else is a load failure naming the table, because silently relocating a
rule to a hook the host never calls is how a kit reports green while gating
nothing.

MEASUREMENT. Spec §4: "No invariant SHIPS without a measurement case." The word
is *ships*, and §5 puts the AC tests in the kit's own ``tests/``. So a record
with no ``measurement:`` LOADS, ``Kit.unmeasured`` names it, and the ship gate
(certification and signing) is where it bites.

SCOPE. Correction 1: the refusal patterns live in the MANIFEST. A `scope` record
carries the severity and the measurement, not patterns of its own.

Two rules hold in every domain and are enforced here, not left to kit authors:

  * **Never refuse the operator's own figure.** If they typed the rate it is
    authoritative input, not a claim to check: the severity softens to `flag`
    and the finding records what it was softened from.
  * A finding names the invariant AND what is missing. "Blocked" on its own
    teaches the caller nothing and gets the layer switched off.
