"""The Figure — what a host hands the evaluator — and the Outcome it gets back.

A vertical platform answers with FIGURES. A figure is usable only if it is
grounded, complete, dimensioned, authorised, its own, current, in scope and
self-consistent. Each of those is a property that can fail, and each failure is
one invariant kind. This module is the data the kinds read.

``span`` is what makes surgical repair possible: a finding on one figure can
replace that figure rather than refusing the whole answer, which matters when a
long answer carries one bad number.

``origin`` is load-bearing for a rule that holds in every domain: **never refuse
the operator's own figure.** If they typed the rate, it is authoritative input,
not a claim to check — flag it and proceed.
