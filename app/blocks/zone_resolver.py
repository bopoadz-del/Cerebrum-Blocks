"""Zone Resolver - the discipline that resolves one zone's clashes, ported
from bim-manager-agent ``app/agents/zone_resolver.py`` (ZoneResolver).

The monitor machinery is the product's; this block enforces the contract
the donor's resolver lives by:

1. Kit resolution order first (gravity last, so a drain is never asked to
   move), then worst-first within a rank.
2. Every candidate runs ALL monitors. Not one, not the cheap two - a
   candidate evaluated by fewer than the full declared set is refused,
   because a single skipped monitor is exactly the hole this discipline
   exists to close.
3. Commit only on a clean sweep; record the monitor evidence either way.
   A sweep with any unprovable check is ``verified_conditional`` - never
   spent as a verification, because a reviewer approving it is accepting
   the named gaps, not being told there were none.
4. After ``max_attempts`` (default 3, deliberately low - a resolver that
   grinds through forty candidates never reaches the ninety easy clashes)
   the clash is escalated with the alternatives tried and the named
   objections.
5. Boundary-owned clashes are NEVER committed here. The element is shared
   with a neighbouring zone; the proposal is handed to the coordinator
   with ``handed_to_coordinator=True`` and no commit record.

In-process: commits are recorded on the block instance, monitor verdicts
arrive in the payload as the caller's monitor set.
