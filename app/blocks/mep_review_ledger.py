#     MonitorResult / aggregate / unprovable_across / run_all)
#   app/review_package.py         - verification_of / enrich_change_set /
#     annotate_bcf (carries the verified-vs-conditional distinction into the
#     deliverables)
#   app/review.py                 - approve / reject / edit decision rules
#     (the apply_review discipline: approve refuses while unacknowledged
#     unprovable checks remain; reject reopens eligible clashes; edit maps a
#     re-monitored verdict to verified / verified_conditional / escalated).
#
# The SQLAlchemy zone/clash ledger is not ported: the review ledger is
# in-process and the monitor implementations remain the caller's (the same
# scope zone_arbitration documents). The verdict math and the deliverable
# enrichment are carried verbatim.

"""Monitor contract.

Three monitors run after every proposal and all three must pass before anything
is committed. They are deliberately separate rather than one big check, because
they fail for different reasons and a reviewer needs to see which one objected:
"this move solves the clash but pushes a duct into the next zone" and "this move
solves the clash but reverses the fall on a drain" are different conversations.

A monitor returns a result, never a bare boolean. A bare boolean cannot say what
it looked at, and a monitor whose reasoning is not recorded is a monitor nobody
can argue with -- which is worse than no monitor at all, because it carries
authority it has not earned.
