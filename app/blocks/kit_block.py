"""Store-facing host for a declarative reasoning kit.

One base class. A kit's block is a subclass that names its kit and nothing else,
which is the whole point of the shared evaluator: the domain lives in
``manifest.yaml`` + ``invariants.yaml``, never in Python.

The host implements the four functions the portable spec's §3 contract names —
``extract_figures``, ``resolve_source``, ``state``, ``apply`` — in the only way a
block can: the CALLER supplies them. A block cannot read a platform's corpus or
its SCADA, so the caller passes figures, source classes and state records in,
and the block returns the outcome for the caller to apply. Nothing here guesses:
no qualifier, claim class, source class or live state is inferred from prose,
because inferring them is the defect this layer exists to catch.

Every hook is exposed. A host that calls only ``answer_time`` silently gets no
``authority`` (H1) or ``band`` (H2) coverage, so ``process`` runs the whole
routing map by default and says which hooks it ran.

Fail closed: an unloadable kit is DISABLED and refuses every statement. It never
degrades to "no invariants".
