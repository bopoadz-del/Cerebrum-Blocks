"""Level Certifier - The_Level's grading/certification battery, ported
verbatim (exact line slices) from:

* level/core/taxonomy.py (whole file) - the 11-class failure taxonomy and
  the severity ladder (Â§4). A closed set: adding a class is a deliberate
  change to this file, reviewed as such.
* level/certify/gates.py (whole file) - fraction-exact gate math (Â§3.5):
  94.6% displayed as 95% is how a target certifies without meeting the
  gate, so comparisons never touch a float or a rounded value. TrustTier:
  CERTIFIED / PROVISIONAL (waived, recorded, never silent) / NOT_CERTIFIED /
  VOID (contaminated run - a verdict about the run, not the target).
* level/grader/independence.py (whole file) - GraderIdentity:
  a run REFUSES to start when grader identity == target fingerprint,
  because self-grading produces a score that means nothing and looks
  exactly like one that does. Refused, not warned.
* level/battery/canary.py (whole file) - content-stable canary minting
  and detection; a canary hit voids the entire run, not just one question.
* level/scorers/base.py Verdict/COUNTED and level/battery/schema.py
  QuestionType and level/harness/records.py TargetFingerprint - the
  minimal types the above depend on.

NOT ported: the scorer implementations (provenance, scope_contamination,
formula_grounding, numeric_digit_integrity), the battery/Question pydantic
schema, the harness runner and the report renderer. The gate action takes
explicit counts; the certifier's "ok whatever tier comes out" contract is
preserved - NOT_CERTIFIED is a verdict reached successfully.

"""The failure-class taxonomy. Architecture §4.

First-class data, not a logging convention. *The class breakdown IS the
product's insight layer* — a report saying "68% passed" is a number; a report
saying "of the 32 that failed, 19 were fabricated figures and 9 cited the
wrong contract" is a finding somebody can act on.

The eleven classes come from The Fork's last 100 merges. They are a closed
set on purpose: a taxonomy that grows a new class every time something
surprising happens stops being a taxonomy and becomes a list of incidents.
Adding one is a deliberate change to this file, reviewed as such.

SEVERITY
--------
Each class carries a default severity because the certifier's gate math needs
one (§3.5: *"core ≥95% with zero Sev-1"*). Severity answers "how much does
this failure cost the person relying on the answer?", not "how hard was it to
find":

``SEV1``
    The answer was wrong and looked right. Nobody downstream had a way to
    tell. These are the failures that make a platform dangerous rather than
    merely unfinished, and they are the reason a gate exists at all.

``SEV2``
    The answer was wrong or absent in a way a careful reader would notice.
    Costly, not silent.

``SEV3``
    The system fell short and said so. A miss, honestly reported, is the
    cheapest kind of failure and must never be scored as if it were the
    first kind.

*"gate config (e.g. core ≥95% with zero Sev-1 · refusal traps 100% · exports

NO ROUNDING, AND WHY IT IS A FRACTION
-------------------------------------
94.6% displayed as "95%" is how a target certifies without meeting the gate.
So the comparison never touches a rounded value and never touches a float:
``passed / total`` is a :class:`~fractions.Fraction`, compared exactly
against a threshold that is also a Fraction. 19/20 is *not* ≥ 0.95 by a hair
in float arithmetic on some inputs, and "by a hair" is precisely the margin
a certification must not turn on.

Percentages appear in the report. They are never what the gate reads.

NO NARRATIVE OVERRIDE
---------------------
:meth:`GateConfig.evaluate` returns a verdict and the arithmetic behind it.
There is no argument for "but the failures were minor" — if a class of
failure should be tolerated, that is a threshold change, made in the config,
visible in the report, and attached to whoever made it.

"""The grader may never be the thing it grades. Architecture §3.4.

*"independence by construction: grader identity may never equal target
fingerprint — enforced in code, run refuses to start otherwise."*

WHY THIS IS A HARD REFUSAL AND NOT A WARNING
--------------------------------------------
Self-grading does not produce a slightly optimistic score; it produces a
score that means nothing at all, and looks exactly like one that does. A
warning gets read once, and every report afterwards carries a number nobody
can defend.

So the run **refuses to start**. Not `failed` — :data:`Status.REFUSED`,
because declining to produce a meaningless number is the platform working.

WHAT COUNTS AS THE SAME
-----------------------
Identity comparison is on ``provider:model:version``, the same value
``TargetFingerprint.identity`` produces, and it is case- and
whitespace-insensitive. A check defeated by capitalisation is not a check.

It deliberately does NOT compare by object or by config: two differently
configured clients pointed at the same model are the same grader for this
purpose, because what makes self-grading worthless is the shared weights,
not the shared object.

THE LIMIT, STATED
-----------------
Two *different* models from the same family and training data are not
independent in any deep sense, and this check will pass them. It catches
the mechanical case — the one that happens by accident, when somebody wires
the grader to the same endpoint they were testing. The deeper question is a
judgement for whoever configures the campaign, and §3.4's human spot-check
queue is where it belongs.

"""Canary strings: proof that a target has seen the exam. Architecture §2, §6.

A canary is a string that exists **only** inside a battery. Nothing else in
the world contains it. If one comes back in a target's answer, the target has
read the battery — and every score in that run is worthless, because the
system under test was holding the answer key.

WHY THIS IS NOT A SCORER
------------------------
A canary hit is not a question the target got wrong. It invalidates the
**run**. Scoring it as one bad answer among ten would let a contaminated
target still certify at 90%, which is precisely backwards: contamination
makes the other nine meaningless too. So detection lives here, the runner
consults it, and §6's target-isolation rule is what it enforces:

    *"the system under test never sees ground truth, scorer code, or
    canaries."*

MINTING
-------
:func:`mint` builds a canary from a caller-supplied token rather than
generating randomness internally. That is deliberate: a battery must hash the
same every time it loads (see ``hashing.py``), and a self-generating canary
would move the hash on every load. The battery author supplies the token
once, at build time, and it is stored.
