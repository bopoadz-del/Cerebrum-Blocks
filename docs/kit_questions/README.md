# The kit question sheets

Each `<kit>.md` here is the **domain owner's own question sheet**, verbatim: the
list of things that domain has to supply before a platform can gate its figures,
in the owner's words, with the owner's own mark on each.

These files are the record. `app/blocks/<kit>/questions.yaml` is a **generated**
view of them:

```
docs/kit_questions/<kit>.md          the record. Edit this.
        │
        │  scripts/import_kit_questions.py
        ▼
app/blocks/<kit>/questions.yaml      generated. Never hand-edit.
```

`tests/blocks/test_kit_interview.py` regenerates every file and fails if what is
committed differs, so the YAML cannot drift from the sheet. Without that guard the
YAML would be a second copy of the same fact, free to be quietly reworded — and a
hand-edit that turned a `[GATE]` question into a `[GAP]` would remove a gate with
nothing to catch it.

```
python scripts/import_kit_questions.py --check   # report, write nothing
python scripts/import_kit_questions.py           # write
```

## What the sheets carry that nothing else could

**`[GATE]` / `[GAP]`.** The owner's own split. A GATE question blocks: the platform
refuses anything needing it and names the question. A GAP question is experience
the platform is better for having and is never blocked without. Before the sheets,
every unanswered figure blocked equally, which would have held a build hostage to
*"what a PM new to fit-out most commonly gets wrong in their first year"*.

An **unmarked** question gates. The FM sheet marks nothing, and a question whose
class cannot be read must block rather than pass — the same fail-closed rule as the
rest of the layer. It is recorded as `gate: null`, so a reader can tell it was
unmarked rather than marked GATE.

**The answer format.** Each sheet opens with its own line:

| kit | fields every answer must arrive with |
|---|---|
| fitout, fm | unit, quality band, market, source, date, confirmed or indicative |
| fire_protection | unit, building/system, code edition, source, date |
| dental | unit, agent/item, adult or paediatric, protocol version, source, date |
| ports_marine | unit, asset/berth, source document, revision, date |

The platform kernel reads this rather than holding a list of its own, so there is
one definition of a complete answer per domain and it is the owner's. An answer
short of any field is refused, not stored partially: a cost without its market and
quality band is not an answer to *"cost per m² by quality band"*, it is a number
that will be cited as one.

**The real subject.** The derived question was *"What is the rate?"* — one number
for a whole domain, and unanswerable in practice. The sheet asks for the rate **per
package**: partitions, ceilings, raised floor, joinery, MEP, fire stopping, T&C,
prelims.

## Where answers go

Nowhere near here. A kit is a signed Store block shared by every customer; answers
are per-platform and live in the built platform's own storage
(`$STORAGE_PATH/reasoning_answers.json`), collected through
`GET`/`POST /v1/reasoning/interview`. A test asserts the kit directory is
byte-identical after an answer is recorded — one client's declared distances
reaching the next platform built from the same kit would be the provenance failure
this layer exists to prevent, and it would arrive signed.

## Coverage

15 of the 17 kits have a sheet, carrying **994 questions** — 647 `[GATE]`, 279
`[GAP]`, 68 unmarked (all of them FM's).

**`datacentre` and `offshore_marine` have no sheet.** They still run, on the
derived per-quantity questions, and every caller that reports interview state says
`questions_source: derived` and never reports them ready. A kit with no sheet and a
kit whose sheet is fully answered both have nothing outstanding; reporting them
alike would call a domain nobody has interviewed ready to gate. Adding an
eighteenth kit without a sheet fails `test_all_fifteen_sheets_are_installed_...`
rather than shipping quietly.
