"""Store-wide conformance report. REPORT-ONLY: this never fails a build.

KERNEL_DEFAULTS 1.4 and 1.6, plus K2 / K3. Five checks over every
block in ``BLOCK_REGISTRY``:

``constructor``
    Liskov. Can the block be constructed the way the base class promises --
    ``Block(hal_block=..., config=...)``? #88 is this check: ``DatabaseBlock``
    narrowed its constructor, so no pipeline could build it, and nothing
    noticed until a zip failed to boot.

``smoke``
    Instantiate and invoke through one harness with the block's declared
    minimal input, and record the resulting ``BlockResult`` status. #87 is
    this check: ``CacheManager``'s local fallback was unreachable, and a
    store-wide invoke would have said so.

``three_tests``
    Does the block have a test file, and does it carry the happy path, the
    planted failure and the mutation probe? (KERNEL_DEFAULTS 1.3.)

``source_class_render``
    KERNEL_DEFAULTS K2. For a RAG-derived block (tags include ``rag``,
    or the module uses the answer contract): does every citation path
    emit ``source_class`` and does the answer layer render it?
    Non-RAG blocks are skipped. REPORT-ONLY.

``coverage_honesty``
    KERNEL_DEFAULTS K3. For a RAG-derived block: is the ``N of M
    indexed`` line present, and is a ``does-not-exist`` claim refused
    below 100% coverage? Non-RAG blocks are skipped. REPORT-ONLY.

``brief_scope``
    L2.2. Does ``block.json`` carry valid ``reads`` / ``writes`` /
    ``never`` / ``acceptance``? Missing or invalid fields are reported.
    Empty lists are valid (measured nothing / could not measure).
    REPORT-ONLY -- ``BRIEF_SCOPE_FAIL_CLOSED`` is False until the
    owner-gated flip. This check walks ``block_registry/``, not just
    ``BLOCK_REGISTRY``, because Factory inventory is a store query.

WHY THIS EXITS 0 NO MATTER WHAT
-------------------------------
Cowork is booting generated zips from this store right now, and these checks
measure code written long before the contract existed. Turning them red today
would block the critical path to report a backlog everybody already knows
about. So the exit code is always 0 and the output is a table.

The flip to enforcing is a SEPARATE PR, after P7 is DONE, with the owner's
tick. Until then: this is reporting, not a gate. Do not describe it as one.

A NOTE ON INVOKING EVERY BLOCK
------------------------------
The smoke check really does call ``process()`` on every block. Blocks that
reach for a network, a database or a key will fail -- that is the point, and
in CI there are no credentials for them to use. Each call is bounded by
``--timeout`` so a block that hangs cannot hang the report.

Usage:
    python scripts/lane2_conformance.py                 # full report
    python scripts/lane2_conformance.py --no-invoke     # skip the smoke
