"""Generate the Store plumbing for every declarative reasoning kit.

A kit is a DECLARATION -- ``app/blocks/<kit>/manifest.yaml`` (vocabulary) plus
``invariants.yaml`` (records). Everything else a kit needs to be a published,
certified Store block is mechanical, so it is generated rather than hand-written
seventeen times:

  app/blocks/<kit>_kit.py                 identity only; no domain logic
  block_registry/<kit>_kit/block.json     manifest, acceptance list from the
                                          kit's own invariants
  block_registry/<kit>_kit/block.py       the standard adapter
  block_registry/<kit>_kit/Dockerfile     copied from the reference block

The block id is `<kit>_kit`, deliberately NOT `<kit>_reasoning`: five kits already
publish a `<kit>_reasoning` block built on a hand-written gate, three of them
signed. The declarative kit is ADDED beside them, never over them.
  block_certifications.json                    entry against `process`

Idempotent, and it never overwrites a signature: `block.json` keeps any
`signature` and `digests` already present, because re-signing on every run would
make the signature meaningless. Run it again whenever a kit is added.

    python scripts/generate_kit_blocks.py            # write
    python scripts/generate_kit_blocks.py --check    # report drift, write nothing
