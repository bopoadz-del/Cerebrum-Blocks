"""Static composition check for every kit in block_store/kits/.

Silence is not permission. A kit that lists eighteen blocks and says nothing
about how they compose is not a kit that "has no ordering constraints" -- it
is a kit whose ordering constraints were never written down. This audit
refuses to read an absent declaration as an empty one.

Pure static analysis: reads JSON and directory listings. No database, no
Redis, no imports of block code. Safe to run in CI and as a publish gate.

Exit 1 if any finding is unregistered, mirroring scripts/audit_stubs.py:
implement it, or register it in KNOWN_KIT_GAPS.md so the gap is visible.
