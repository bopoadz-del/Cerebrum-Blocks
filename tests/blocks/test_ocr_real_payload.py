"""OCRBlock.process — entry-point coverage, and the wall it runs into.

Why this file exists
--------------------
``tests/blocks/test_ocr.py`` drives ``execute`` and asserts only the
UniversalBlock envelope keys, so the control-delete in
``scripts/certify_block.py`` gutted ``OCRBlock.process`` and that suite stayed
GREEN.

What this file found, and what fixed it
---------------------------------------
``OCRBlock.process`` could not reach a real artifact in this Store *at all*.
For any input that resolved to an existing file it called ``_process_image``,
whose first statement is ``_detect_markup``, whose first statement is

    from app.core.redline import detect_redlines, summarize_markup

— an unconditional import, outside the function's ``try``. Neither
``app.core.redline`` nor ``app.core.image_quality`` (imported a few lines later
for ``summarize_ocr_quality``) existed here: ``app/blocks/ocr.py`` had been
copied in without the two core modules it depends on. So every image and every
PDF raised ``ModuleNotFoundError`` before a single pixel was read, and
``UniversalBlock.execute`` swallowed it into a generic error envelope — which
is exactly why the block looked certifiable.

It surfaced outside the tests too: the Factory's CLONER walks the same imports
to build a product's runtime slice and refused the whole clone with
``runtime slice needs app/core/redline.py which does not exist in the Store
checkout`` — correctly, since vendoring ocr without it ships a latent
ImportError to the customer.

Both modules now exist (ported from The_Fork, where they were already
implemented and tested — see tests/core/test_redline.py and
tests/core/test_image_quality.py). The registry's earlier note blamed a missing
OCR fixture; the fixture was never the blocker.
``tests/fixtures/drawing_tm_1100010.pdf`` is a real 485 KB construction
drawing, and the tests at the bottom of this file now read it end to end.
