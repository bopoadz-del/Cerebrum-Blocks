"""Oil & gas operations — acceptance criteria AC1-AC11, plus the manifest
loader contract and the no-bypass check. Written fail-first: every
block-severity invariant has a test that triggers it.

Behaviour, not shape. Each test drives ``gate_answer`` with the statement that
should be refused and asserts the verdict AND the named reason, because a
