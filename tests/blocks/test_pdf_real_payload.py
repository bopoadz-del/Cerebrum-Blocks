"""PDFBlock.process — entry-point coverage against a real drawing on disk.

Why this file exists
--------------------
``tests/blocks/test_pdf.py`` drives ``execute`` and asserts only the
UniversalBlock envelope keys (``block``/``request_id``/``status``/``result``/
``confidence``). ``TypedBlock.execute`` supplies every one of those regardless
of what ``process`` returned, so the control-delete in
``scripts/certify_block.py`` (bar 3) gutted ``PDFBlock.process`` to
``{"block": ..., "status": "success"}`` and the suite stayed GREEN.

Every assertion below is on a value ``process`` had to compute from a real
file: text lifted out of the title block of a 485 KB Jacobs construction
drawing, the page count, the engine that won the parser race, the basename it
derived, and the exact error strings the two rejection paths produce. None of
them survive a gutted ``process``.
