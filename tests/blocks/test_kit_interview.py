"""The interview: the domain owner's own question sheets, as the kits carry them.

The sheets in ``docs/kit_questions/`` are the record of what was asked for, in the
owner's words. ``app/blocks/<kit>/questions.yaml`` is a GENERATED view of them. The
first test here is therefore the important one: it regenerates every file from its
sheet and fails if what is committed differs. Without it the YAML is a second copy
of the same fact, free to drift, and a hand-edit that quietly reworded a [GATE]
question into a [GAP] would never be caught.
