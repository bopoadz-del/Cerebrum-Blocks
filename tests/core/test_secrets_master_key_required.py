"""The secrets block must fail hard without CEREBRUM_MASTER_KEY.

Before this, a missing master key silently fell back to a key derived from the
hardcoded constant ``cerebrum_dev_secret_v1`` — every deployment that forgot to
set the env var shared one attacker-known key, so every stored secret was
trivially decryptable. Boot must now raise when the key is absent, and succeed
when it is present.
