"""CI gates and intentional-absence logging.

Hardening guarantees pinned here:

* The backend CI job actually runs the stub audit and the secret scan —
  both scripts existed but were never wired into the workflow, so their
  gates had never fired on a PR.
* The lockfile-consistency job is scheduled and required. A checker that
  is not in the workflow is a skip; a job with continue-on-error is the
  same skip under another name.
* A vector store deliberately deployed without ``DATABASE_URL`` (the
  store service runs no RAG demo flows) logs its absence at INFO, not
  WARNING. Intentional configuration must not read as a fault in the
  boot log.
