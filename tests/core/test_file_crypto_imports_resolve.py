"""The lazy `from app.core.file_crypto import open_plaintext` imports must resolve.

Regression for a launch-audit follow-up finding (2026-08-02): Phase 1 (#53)
merged blocks whose read paths lazily import ``app.core.file_crypto``, but the
module itself lived only on an unmerged branch. On production main, every
execution of the image block's metadata path and the OCR block's process path
raised ``ModuleNotFoundError`` — and OCR is in the FREE tier's block
allowlist, so the platform's entry-tier functionality was dead on arrival.

A plain ``import app.core.file_crypto`` would not have caught this shape:
the imports are inside function bodies, so the break only surfaces when the
block actually runs. These tests drive the real call paths.
