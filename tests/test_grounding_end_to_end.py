"""Grounding, exercised the way a generated product actually runs it.

`test_formula_grounding.py` proves the resolver's logic against fixtures.
This file closes the two gaps that leaves:

1. **Nobody had ever run the resolver against the real kernel set.** The
   definitions live in the other repository and reach a product through
   ``generator._write_app``'s copytree. The two halves had only ever met
   through a fixture I wrote, which means a schema change on either side
   would have gone unnoticed until a client saw it.

2. **Nobody had run the block.** The resolver returning the right answer and
   the executor putting that answer in its output are different claims.

The cross-repo test skips, loudly, when the kernel is not checked out beside
this repo -- CI does not have it. The block tests build their own product
tree and always run.
