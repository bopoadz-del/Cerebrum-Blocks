"""Every installable kit must ship the artifacts its manifest declares.

Live finding (2026-08-26): ``automotive`` declared 18 artifacts and shipped
14. ``container_kit_store.install_kit`` raised
``ContainerKitError("bundle incomplete")`` while the store still listed the
kit ``available`` -- a kit that advertises itself and then refuses at the
last step. The four absent paths had been added at the kit root by #64 and
never mirrored into ``bundle/``.

WHY THE GATE IS ``status``/``artifacts`` AND NOT ``bundle_ready``
----------------------------------------------------------------
There is no ``bundle_ready`` key in any manifest -- readiness is *computed*
by ``container_kit_store._bundle_ready`` as "every declared artifact exists
in bundle/". Gating this test on that would make it circular: it could only
run on kits that already pass it, so it would have skipped automotive and
passed green while the bug shipped. The condition below is the one
``install_kit`` actually applies, so a kit cannot be installable and exempt
at the same time.
