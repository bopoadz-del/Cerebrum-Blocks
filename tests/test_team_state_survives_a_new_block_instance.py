"""A team created by one block instance must still be there for the next one.

This is a boot-regression test, not a unit test. It was written because a
generated platform booted, passed its own gate, and could not persist a single
record: the dispatcher builds a fresh block for every action, so `create_team`
followed by `get_team` answered "Team not found" inside a single process.

The distinguishing move in every test below is constructing a SECOND
``TeamBlock`` -- that stands in for the next dispatch call, the next request,
and the next boot. A test that reuses one instance passes against the bug and
is therefore worthless here.
