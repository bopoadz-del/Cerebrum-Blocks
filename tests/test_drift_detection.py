"""Drift detection in the LearningEngine + CredibilityScorer.

Phase 1 of the auto-retraining pipeline (docs/design/auto-retraining.md):
the engine must detect when a formula's accuracy has degraded since the
last tier change and emit a structured drift event. These tests pin
that behaviour end-to-end against the block API plus the underlying
``CredibilityScorer.detect_drift`` primitive.
