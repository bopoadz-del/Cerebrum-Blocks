"""Liveness, readiness, and diagnostics boundaries.

Three defects are pinned here:

1. `/health` was unauthenticated and shelled out to the Kimi CLI on every
   hit, returning subprocess stdout, subprocess stderr, and the raw value
   of the KIMI_CLI_PATH env var to any caller. Render polls it
   continuously.
2. `/health` returned "healthy" unconditionally, so a service with an
   unwritable data disk was indistinguishable from a working one and the
   platform health check could never fail.
3. `/stats` returned the same block inventory that `/blocks` is
   deliberately auth-gated to protect, nullifying that gate.

The shapes below therefore assert on what an *unauthenticated* caller can
observe — the response bytes and the side effects — rather than on how the
router is wired internally. The original capability semantic ("a
registered block is not a capability unless the CLI actually answers") is
preserved, but exercised against the authenticated diagnostics endpoint
and with a mocked subprocess, so it no longer depends on being able to
execute a `#!/bin/sh` script (which never worked on Windows).
